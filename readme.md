<h1>Global Beverage Corporation Exchange Trading Platform</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This application is the trading platform for the GBCE. It contains all the files needed to perform basic stock market calculations and record trades.

<h2>Initial Setup</h2>
This application contains core features only, and does not have any APIs or external DB connections.
Currently, data is stored within the project files as JSON and CSV (JSON for stock data, CSV for trades data).
To use the features, the user currently has to access the objects manually and individually.
